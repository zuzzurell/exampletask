    description: >
        This model performs several analyses on Globepay transaction data. 
        It calculates the daily acceptance rate, identifies countries where declined transactions exceed $25M, 
        and lists transactions missing chargeback data. The output combines these analyses to provide insights 
        into transaction acceptance rates, high-value declined transactions, and missing chargebacks.
